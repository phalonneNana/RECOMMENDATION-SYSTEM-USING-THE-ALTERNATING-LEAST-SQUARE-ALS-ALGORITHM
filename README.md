# Goal
Recommender systems are becoming increasingly popular in today's world, and the MovieLens dataset is one of the most widely used datasets for building such systems. 
So The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their previous movie ratings. 

# Dataset
The smaller MovieLens dataset is a subset of the larger MovieLens dataset, which contains movie ratings from users. The smaller dataset contains 100,834 ratings from 610 users 
on 9724 movies. Each rating is a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being the highest rating.
The dataset also includes demographic information about the users, such as age, gender, occupation, and zip code. In addition, it includes genre information about the movies, 
such as action, comedy, drama, and so on. The smaller MovieLens dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for building recom- mendation systems. It is small enough to 
be easily manageable, yet large enough to provide meaningful insights into the performance of different recommendation algorithms.

# Results
By incorporating data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engi- neering, and model building, we can create a powerful tool for movie enthusiasts to discover 
new movies that they will love. Additionally, by considering 2D embeddings graph, addition of latent trait vectors using ALS we continually improve the accuracy and relevance 
of the recommendations. Overall, this project has the potential to revolutionize the way we discover and enjoy movies, and we look forward to seeing the impact it will have on 
the movie industry and its enthusiasts.
