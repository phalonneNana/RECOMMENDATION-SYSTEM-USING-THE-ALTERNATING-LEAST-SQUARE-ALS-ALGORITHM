# Goal
 I undertook the development of a recommendation system project aimed at enhancing the personalized movie-watching experience for millions of users. The primary objective is to efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of movie rating data and provide tailored movie suggestions based on users' previous ratings.

# Dataset
The smaller MovieLens dataset is a subset of the larger MovieLens dataset, which contains movie ratings from users. The smaller dataset contains 100,834 ratings from 610 users 
on 9724 movies. Each rating is a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being the highest rating.
The dataset also includes demographic information about the users, such as age, gender, occupation, and zip code. In addition, it includes genre information about the movies, 
such as action, comedy, drama, and so on. The smaller MovieLens dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for building recom- mendation systems. It is small enough to 
be easily manageable, yet large enough to provide meaningful insights into the performance of different recommendation algorithms.

# Results
Through a comprehensive approach that encompassed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of the ALS algorithm, I created a robust recommendation system. This system empowers movie enthusiasts to discover new films that align with their preferences, ultimately enhancing their movie-watching experience.

One noteworthy aspect of the project involved employing 2D embeddings graphs and incorporating latent trait vectors using the ALS algorithm. These techniques significantly improved the accuracy and relevance of movie recommendations. In essence, this project has the potential to revolutionize how individuals discover and enjoy movies, with far-reaching implications for the movie industry and its devoted enthusiasts.
